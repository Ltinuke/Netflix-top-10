# Netflix-top-10
In this Netflix Data Analytic project, I used SQL to answer key investor questions based on the weekly Top 10 Netflix Data. Each week, Netflix publishes its top 10 titles, along with the number of hours spent watching each one. 
These are split up into four categories: Films(English), Films (Non-English), TV (English) and TV (Non-English). Some investor questions about Netflix that this data can help address are: Is Netflix producing and licensing engaging content? 
Are Netflix's content investments in new genres or geographies generating significant viewership? How is viewership trending over time and what implications does it have over subscriber numbers?
